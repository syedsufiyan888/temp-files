            <h2>About...</h2>
            <p>I’m Syed Sufiyan, and I’ve completed my BCA - Bachelor of Computer Applications with a specialization in web development. I’m passionate about front-end technologies, and I’m skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also work extensively with React to build dynamic user interfaces. I believe in the importance of version control, so I use Git and GitHub to manage my projects effectively. I’m excited to create engaging, user-friendly web experiences and continuously learn new technologies. Let’s connect and explore what we can build together!</p>
